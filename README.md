Throttle configurer for Flight Simulators using SimConnect

Allows manual configuration of throttle axes for any flight simulator that supports SimConnect.  
Primarily meant for MSFS.

## Note: Ingame throttle axis should be unbound to avoid conflict. I recommend making a new controls profile for this.

Pre-pre-alpha.
